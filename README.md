# SnakeRedux
An old, humorously unpredictable clone of Snake made as a programmer's right-of-passage.

Like most programmers I once wrote a clone of Snake as a beginner's project / midterm. I was surprised to find that I could actually coax it to work these years later.
Its most humorous feature is that the speed of the entire game is dependent on the speed of the snake, meaning that, for example, more items spawn with a faster snake in "Chaos Mode." You can try it for yourself and see what I mean.
Aside from that, one might find a number of other unusual "quirks" (intended features!) here. Its value is historical and needless to say I'm not planning on continuing development :)

Happy nonstalgia!
