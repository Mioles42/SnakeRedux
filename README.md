# SnakeRedux
An old, humorously unpredictable clone of Snake made as a programmer's rite of passage. 

Like most programmers I once wrote a clone of Snake as a beginner's project / midterm. That was in 2015; since then I decided I'd like to keep it for historical reasons. 
Its most humorous feature is that the speed of the entire game is dependent on the speed of the snake, meaning that, for example, more items spawn with a faster snake in "Chaos Mode." You can try it for yourself and see what I mean. In general it's full of quirks (intended features!) like that which made for a good learning experience.
Happy nonstalgia!
